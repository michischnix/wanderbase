      "The shoulder seasons—late spring (April to June) and early autumn (September to October)—offer the best value.

The weather is still pleasant for outdoor activities, and you can enjoy the stunning alpine scenery without the peak season price tags.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the most affordable accommodation options in the Alps?",
    answer:
      "Hostels and guesthouses are excellent budget-friendly options, often featuring shared kitchens where you can prepare your own meals. Camping is another great choice, with many national parks offering well-maintained campsites at a fraction of hotel costs. Homestays through platforms like Airbnb provide authentic local experiences while keeping costs down, often including meals and insider tips from your hosts.",

    question: "How can I save money on transportation in the Alps?",

For shorter distances, biking and hiking are free alternatives that let you experience the landscape at your own pace. Many trails are well-marked and accessible without any fees.",

Look for budget-friendly brands during off-season sales. Consider renting expensive items like trekking poles or camping stoves if you're only going once. Many outdoor stores offer affordable options, and second-hand gear can be found at thrift stores or online marketplaces.",
