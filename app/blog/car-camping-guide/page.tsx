                Car camping bridges the gap between backpacking and RV camping, offering the perfect balance of

                Why Choose Car Camping?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Car camping offers unique advantages that make it ideal for both beginners and experienced outdoor
                enthusiasts. You get the flexibility to bring more gear, the security of having your vehicle nearby, and
                the ability to easily relocate if conditions change.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-green my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-green-50 border-green-400 text-green-900">
                <strong>💰 Money Saver:</strong> Car camping eliminates hotel costs and reduces gear investment. You can
                use regular household items instead of specialized ultralight equipment, saving hundreds of dollars.
              </div>

              <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Carry more comfort items without weight restrictions</li>
                <li>Easy access to your vehicle for supplies and emergency exit</li>
                <li>Weather protection and secure storage</li>
                <li>Ability to power devices with your car's electrical system</li>
                <li>Perfect for families with children or pets</li>
                <li>Great stepping stone to more advanced camping styles</li>
              </ul>

                Setting Up Your Vehicle
              </h2>

              <p>
                Any vehicle can work for car camping, from compact cars to full-size SUVs. The key is maximizing your
                available space and organizing gear efficiently. Even small cars can accommodate comfortable camping
                setups with proper planning.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-blue my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-blue-50 border-blue-400 text-blue-900">
                <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Fold-down rear seats create a flat sleeping surface in most SUVs and
                wagons. Add a foam mattress topper for comfort that rivals many beds at home.
              </div>

              <h3>Interior Organization</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Use storage bins and organizers to maximize space</li>
                <li>Create a sleeping platform in SUVs or wagons</li>
                <li>Install window covers for privacy and temperature control</li>
                <li>Set up a portable power station for device charging</li>
                <li>Organize gear by frequency of use (daily items easily accessible)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>External Setup</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Awning or tarp for additional covered space</li>
                <li>Portable camp chairs and table</li>
                <li>External storage solutions (roof box, hitch cargo carrier)</li>
                <li>Recovery gear for off-road situations</li>
                <li>Portable camp kitchen setup</li>
              </ul>

                Essential Car Camping Gear
              </h2>

              <p>
                Car camping allows you to bring gear that would be impossible to carry on your back. Focus on comfort
                and convenience items that enhance your outdoor experience without the weight penalties of backpacking.
              </p>

              <h3>Sleep System</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Comfortable sleeping pad or air mattress</li>
                <li>Regular sleeping bags or blankets (weight isn't critical)</li>
                <li>Pillows from home or inflatable camping pillows</li>
                <li>Sheets and extra blankets for temperature regulation</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Cooking and Food Storage</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Portable camp stove with multiple burners</li>
                <li>Large cooler with ice or 12V electric cooler</li>
                <li>Full-size cookware and utensils</li>
                <li>Portable camp kitchen with prep space</li>
                <li>Water containers (5+ gallons for extended trips)</li>
                <li>Camp sink or wash basin</li>
              </ul>

                Choosing Your Campsite
              </h2>

              <p>
                Campsite selection for car camping involves different considerations than backpacking. You need vehicle
                access, level ground for sleeping, and space for your extended setup while considering privacy and
                natural features.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-yellow my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-400 text-yellow-900">
                <strong>📋 Planning Tip:</strong> Arrive at popular car camping spots early in the day, especially on
                weekends. The best sites with level ground and privacy fill up quickly during peak seasons.
              </div>

              <h3>Site Evaluation Checklist</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Level ground for comfortable sleeping</li>
                <li>Vehicle access and parking space</li>
                <li>Distance from water sources (200+ feet)</li>
                <li>Wind protection from natural features</li>
                <li>Morning sun exposure for warmth and drying</li>
                <li>Privacy from other campers</li>
                <li>Established fire ring if fires are permitted</li>
              </ul>

                Maximizing Comfort
              </h2>

              <p>
                The beauty of car camping lies in the ability to bring comfort items that transform your outdoor
                experience. With thoughtful setup and the right gear, you can create a basecamp that rivals the comfort
                of home.

                Car camping isn't about roughing it—it's about enjoying nature with all the comforts that make the
                experience memorable and repeatable.

              <h3>Comfort Enhancements</h3>
              <ul>

              </h2>

              <p>
                Car camping generally offers more security than backcountry camping, but you still need to consider
                personal safety, vehicle security, and emergency preparedness. Your vehicle provides both protection and
                a means of quick evacuation if needed.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-red my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-red-50 border-red-400 text-red-900">
                <strong>⚠️ Safety Warning:</strong> Never run your vehicle engine or generator inside enclosed spaces.
                Carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious risk. Always ensure proper ventilation when using any
                fuel-burning devices.
              </div>

              <h3>Security Measures</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Lock valuable items in your vehicle when away from camp</li>
                <li>Use window covers to prevent visibility into your vehicle</li>
                <li>Keep keys accessible but secure while sleeping</li>
                <li>Inform someone of your camping location and return plans</li>
                <li>Carry emergency communication devices for remote areas</li>
                <li>Keep a well-stocked first aid kit and know how to use it</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Car camping opens up incredible opportunities for outdoor adventure while maintaining the comfort and
                security that many people need to truly enjoy nature. Whether you're planning weekend getaways or
                extended road trips, mastering car camping techniques will enhance every outdoor experience.
              </p>
