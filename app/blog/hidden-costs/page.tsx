                The Tourist Tax Trap That Everyone Forgets
              </h2>

              <p>
                {
                  'Every single Alpine town charges a "Kurtaxe" or tourist tax, and it\'s rarely mentioned during booking. This seemingly small fee adds up quickly across multiple destinations.\n'
                }
              </p>

              <p>
                In Zermatt, you'll pay ‚Ç¨3.50 per night on top of your accommodation costs. For a week's stay, that's an
                extra ‚Ç¨24.50 you never budgeted for. Multiply this across several towns on a longer hiking trip, and
                you're looking at an additional ‚Ç¨50-100 that wasn't in your original calculations.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-blue my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-blue-50 border-blue-400 text-blue-900">
                <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Always ask about tourist tax when booking any accommodation, and budget an
                extra ‚Ç¨3-4 per night in your total costs. Some tourist cards actually include this tax, so it's worth
                asking your accommodation if they offer any packages that bundle the fee with other services.

                Mountain Transport: The 400% Markup Nobody Talks About
              </h2>

              <p>
                Cable cars and mountain railways represent one of the steepest markups you'll encounter in the Alps. A
                simple return trip can cost ‚Ç¨40 or more, turning a budget day hike into an expensive excursion.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here's where smart planning makes a massive difference. Instead of purchasing return tickets, hike up
                and ride down‚Äîthis immediately cuts your transport costs by 50%. Many cable car operators offer "Good
                Morning" tickets for early departures that are 30% cheaper than standard fares.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-green my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-green-50 border-green-400 text-green-900">
                <strong>üí∞ Money Saver:</strong> In Austria particularly, many cable cars offer free transport when you
                book overnight accommodation. This isn't widely advertised, but a simple phone call to your hotel can
                save you significant money.
              </div>

              <h2 className="my-6 text-2xl" id="insurance-gap">
                The Emergency Insurance Gap That Could Cost Thousands
              </h2>

              <p>
                Mountain rescue operations can cost upwards of ‚Ç¨10,000 without proper insurance coverage. Your standard
                travel insurance likely doesn't cover specialized mountain rescue, helicopter evacuations, or medical
                treatment at high altitude.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-red my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-red-50 border-red-400 text-red-900">
                <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:</strong> The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) covers basic medical emergencies,
                but you'll need additional mountain rescue coverage. This typically costs ‚Ç¨20-40 per year and can be
                added to existing travel insurance policies.
              </div>

              <p>
                The Austrian Alpine Club membership at ‚Ç¨58 per year includes worldwide mountain rescue coverage and
                often pays for itself on a single trip. Club members also receive discounts at mountain huts throughout
                the Alps.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl my-6" id="gear-fails">
                When Gear Fails: The Mid-Trip Replacement Nightmare
              </h2>

              <p>
                Nothing destroys a hiking budget faster than equipment failure in remote locations. Broken hiking boots
                or torn rain gear can cost ‚Ç¨100-300 to replace mid-trip, and mountain gear shops charge premium prices.
              </p>

              <p>
                Prevention is your best strategy here. Test all equipment on local day hikes before committing to
                multi-day Alpine adventures. Pack a basic repair kit with duct tape, needle and thread, and superglue
                for emergency fixes.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-blue my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-blue-50 border-blue-400 text-blue-900">
                <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Research gear shops in your planned destinations before departure‚Äîknowing
                where to find replacements reduces stress and often reveals better pricing options.
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl my-6" id="altitude-tax">
                The Altitude Tax: Why Mountain Food Costs Triple
              </h2>

              <p>
                Mountain huts operate under challenging logistics, with supplies often delivered by helicopter. This
                results in food markups of 200-400% compared to valley prices. A simple pasta dish that costs ‚Ç¨8 in town
                becomes ‚Ç¨20-25 at altitude.
              </p>

              <p>
                Smart hikers adapt their eating strategy accordingly. Plan one substantial meal in town each day, then
                pack lightweight, high-energy snacks for the trails. Energy bars, nuts, and dried fruit provide
                excellent nutrition without the premium prices.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-green my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-green-50 border-green-400 text-green-900">
                <strong>üí∞ Money Saver:</strong> Water refills are usually free at mountain huts, so carry a large
                bottle to minimize beverage purchases. The key is shifting your mindset from relying on mountain dining
                to treating it as an occasional splurge.
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl my-6" id="parking-expense">
                Parking: The Hidden Daily Expense
              </h2>

              <p>
                Trailhead parking fees range from ‚Ç¨5-15 per day, with parking fines reaching ‚Ç¨50-100 for violations.
                Popular hiking destinations often have complex parking regulations that catch tourists off-guard.
              </p>

              <p>
                Research parking costs and regulations before choosing trailheads. Public transport is often cheaper
                than daily parking fees, especially for multi-day stays. Download parking apps like EasyPark for
                cashless payment‚Äîmany Alpine parking zones only accept exact change or card payments.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-blue my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-blue-50 border-blue-400 text-blue-900">
                <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> Consider staying in towns with good public transport connections to hiking
                areas. The slight inconvenience of a bus or train journey often saves money and eliminates parking
                stress entirely.

                Weather Contingency: The Budget Killer Nobody Plans For
              </h2>

              <p>
                Alpine weather changes rapidly, forcing expensive last-minute plan modifications. Sudden storms can
                require unplanned accommodation nights, alternative activities, or complete route changes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Maintain a 20% contingency fund specifically for weather-related expenses. Book accommodation with
                flexible cancellation policies when possible, even if it costs slightly more upfront. Research indoor
                alternatives and backup activities for each destination before arrival.
              </p>

              <div className="callout callout-yellow my-8 p-6 border-l-4 bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-400 text-yellow-900">
                <strong>üìã Planning Tip:</strong> Weather contingency isn't just about money‚Äîit's about maintaining trip
                enjoyment when nature doesn't cooperate with your original plans.
              </div>

              <h2 className="text-2xl my-6" id="defense-strategy">
                Building Your Hidden Cost Defense Strategy
              </h2>

              <p>
                Before your next Alpine adventure, implement these protective measures. Add 15-20% to your calculated
                budget specifically for unexpected expenses. Research mountain transport discounts and partnership deals
                in your planned destinations.
              </p>

              <p>
                Verify your insurance coverage includes mountain rescue and high-altitude medical treatment. Test all
                gear thoroughly on local practice hikes. Download essential apps for parking, weather monitoring, and
                emergency situations.
              </p>

              <blockquote className="my-12 pl-8 border-l-4 border-primary italic text-xl font-medium">
                Most importantly, shift your mindset from expecting everything to go according to plan to building

                experiences‚Äîand punish the unprepared with expensive surprises.
