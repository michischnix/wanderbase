      question: "What is the tourist tax (Kurtaxe) and how much does it typically cost?",
      answer:
        "Tourist tax is a mandatory fee charged by Alpine towns for overnight stays, typically ranging from €2-4 per person per night. It's rarely included in accommodation prices and can add €50-100 to a week-long trip across multiple destinations. Always ask about this fee when booking to avoid budget surprises.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I save money on mountain cable cars and lifts?",
      answer:
        "Save 50% by hiking up and riding down instead of buying return tickets. Look for 'Good Morning' tickets offering 30% discounts for early departures. In Austria, many accommodations include free cable car access—always ask when booking. Multi-day passes often provide better value than single rides if you plan multiple ascents.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I really need specialized mountain rescue insurance?",
      answer:
        "Yes, absolutely. Standard travel insurance and EHIC cards don't cover mountain rescue operations, which can cost €10,000+. Specialized coverage costs only €20-40 annually through organizations like the Austrian Alpine Club, which also provides mountain hut discounts that often offset the membership cost.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is food so expensive at mountain huts?",
      answer:
        "Mountain huts receive supplies via helicopter due to remote locations, creating 200-400% markups compared to valley prices. A €8 pasta dish in town costs €20-25 at altitude. Reduce costs by packing high-energy snacks, eating one substantial meal in town daily, and taking advantage of free water refills at huts.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much should I budget for unexpected weather-related expenses?",
      answer:
        "Add 20% to your total budget specifically for weather contingencies. Alpine weather changes rapidly, potentially requiring unplanned accommodation nights, alternative activities, or route changes. Book flexible cancellation policies when possible and research indoor alternatives for each destination before arrival.",

            Planning your dream Alpine hiking trip? You've probably calculated accommodation, food, and transport costs.
            But what about the hidden expenses that can double your budget overnight?
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            After years of documenting budget Alpine adventures, the same costly mistakes appear repeatedly. These are
            the 7 hidden costs that catch everyone off-guard—and proven strategies to avoid them.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-6 leading-tight" style={{ color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            The Tourist Tax Trap That Everyone Forgets
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Every single Alpine town charges a "Kurtaxe" or tourist tax, and it's rarely mentioned during booking. This
            seemingly small fee adds up quickly across multiple destinations.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            In Zermatt, you'll pay €3.50 per night on top of your accommodation costs. For a week's stay, that's an
            extra €24.50 you never budgeted for. Multiply this across several towns on a longer hiking trip, and you're
            looking at an additional €50-100 that wasn't in your original calculations.
          </p>

            Mountain Transport: The 400% Markup Nobody Talks About
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Cable cars and mountain railways represent one of the steepest markups you'll encounter in the Alps. A
            simple return trip can cost €40 or more, turning a budget day hike into an expensive excursion.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Here's where smart planning makes a massive difference. Instead of purchasing return tickets, hike up and
            ride down—this immediately cuts your transport costs by 50%. Many cable car operators offer "Good Morning"
            tickets for early departures that are 30% cheaper than standard fares.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-6 leading-tight" style={{ color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            The Emergency Insurance Gap That Could Cost Thousands
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Mountain rescue operations can cost upwards of €10,000 without proper insurance coverage. Your standard
            travel insurance likely doesn't cover specialized mountain rescue, helicopter evacuations, or medical
            treatment at high altitude.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            The Austrian Alpine Club membership at €58 per year includes worldwide mountain rescue coverage and often
            pays for itself on a single trip. Club members also receive discounts at mountain huts throughout the Alps.
          </p>

            When Gear Fails: The Mid-Trip Replacement Nightmare
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Nothing destroys a hiking budget faster than equipment failure in remote locations. Broken hiking boots or
            torn rain gear can cost €100-300 to replace mid-trip, and mountain gear shops charge premium prices.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Prevention is your best strategy here. Test all equipment on local day hikes before committing to multi-day
            Alpine adventures. Pack a basic repair kit with duct tape, needle and thread, and superglue for emergency
            fixes.
          </p>

            The Altitude Tax: Why Mountain Food Costs Triple
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Mountain huts operate under challenging logistics, with supplies often delivered by helicopter. This results
            in food markups of 200-400% compared to valley prices. A simple pasta dish that costs €8 in town becomes
            €20-25 at altitude.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Smart hikers adapt their eating strategy accordingly. Plan one substantial meal in town each day, then pack
            lightweight, high-energy snacks for the trails. Energy bars, nuts, and dried fruit provide excellent
            nutrition without the premium prices.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-16 mb-6 leading-tight" style={{ color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Parking: The Hidden Daily Expense
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Trailhead parking fees range from €5-15 per day, with parking fines reaching €50-100 for violations. Popular
            hiking destinations often have complex parking regulations that catch tourists off-guard.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Research parking costs and regulations before choosing trailheads. Public transport is often cheaper than
            daily parking fees, especially for multi-day stays. Download parking apps like EasyPark for cashless
            payment—many Alpine parking zones only accept exact change or card payments.
          </p>

            Weather Contingency: The Budget Killer Nobody Plans For
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Alpine weather changes rapidly, forcing expensive last-minute plan modifications. Sudden storms can require
            unplanned accommodation nights, alternative activities, or complete route changes.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed" style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.6", color: "#1E1E1E" }}>
            Maintain a 20% contingency fund specifically for weather-related expenses. Book accommodation with flexible
            cancellation policies when possible, even if it costs slightly more upfront. Research indoor alternatives
            and backup activities for each destination before arrival.
